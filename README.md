# Bootstrap_Portfolio
Portfolio for 2nd homework made with bootstrap.

so far bootstrap has been a blast! Finding the bits of code you want to include and then trying to figure out where they go is great and really gives me the feeling of solving a puzzle. However, there are a few things I would rather use over Bootstrap when building a webpage.

 for instance the Glyphicons I have incuded in the contact me page of this portfolio site are pretty terrible. I would rather use font awesome simply for the sheer amount of actual official company logo icons Font Awesome has available for use for free over the ones you have to pay for on the glyphicon website.
 
  The other thing that I wasnt a huge fan of was also on the contact page where the text boxes were. I loved the idea that allowed them to have their own Icons next to the text box. But they were uneven at the end making it not as Uniform as I would have liked.

  there were a few more things that I wasnt a huge fan of but I figured could be fixed with a thematic bootstrap or simply by changing the CSS of the few things. But if im going to have to write a ton of CSS anyway I would rather keep the Bootstrap working to a bare minimum (really only using it for responsive imgs and pages as well as with grid systems) and finishing out the styling organically in my own Stylesheet.

after this homework I will probably continue working on the other web portfolio page I have in the works so that i cna personalize it a bit more to my liking. If that one works out the way im hoping it will then I think that will be my preferred portfolio set up.
